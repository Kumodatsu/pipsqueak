# Pipsqueak

An insignificant engine for insignificant applications.

Pipsqueak is a framework for creating interactive applications, such as games.

I am developing this for fun and learning, so its purpose is not to provide a
fully featured engine or compete with other (game) engines.

## Setup

All commands listed here, except those in the "Prerequisites" section, should be
run from the repository's root directory unless otherwise specified.

### Prerequisites

- [Git][git]
- [CMake 3.23.0 or later][cmake]
- Some C++ build environment, such as g++ (≥ 13) and Make or MSVC.

On Linux, you also need the X11 development libraries to build GLFW, which is a
dependency of Pipsqueak:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xorg-dev
```

If this command does not work on your distribution, check
[GLFW's documentation][glfw-deps].

Clone the repository and initialize its submodules:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

### Building

Generate the project files needed for your build environment:

    cmake -B "./build"

You can now manually use your build environment of choice to build the project,
or have CMake handle it by running:

    cmake --build "./build"

## Testing

Generate the project files with testing enabled and build the project:

    cmake -B "./build" -D BUILD_TESTS=ON
    cmake --build "./build"

Move into the build directory and run the tests:

    cd ./build
    ctest -V -C Debug

## Example projects

Generate the project files with examples enabled and build the project:

    cmake -B "./build" -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
    cmake --build "./build"

To run, find the executables in the `build` folder.
Currently, the exact location depends on your toolchain.
